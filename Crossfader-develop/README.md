#Include in your project
##Using Maven
The Crossfader Library is pushed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.mikepenz%22), so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.

```javascript
compile('com.mikepenz:crossfader:1.3.6@aar') {
	transitive = true
}
```

##How to use

Initialize and create the Crossfader
```java
crossFader = new Crossfader()
	//provide the view which should be the main content
        .withContent(findViewById(R.id.crossfade_content))
        //provide the view and it's width (in pixels) which should be displayed first
        .withFirst(result.getSlider(), firstWidth)
        //provide the view and it's width (in pixels) which should be displayed after fading
        .withSecond(miniResult.build(this), secondWidth)
        //provde the saved instance state to store the previous state of the crossfade view
        .withSavedInstance(savedInstanceState)
        //build and inflate everything
        .build();
        //Awesome everything is set and working
```

Programmatically crossFade the view
```java
//check if the view is crossFaded
if (crossFader.isCrossFaded()) {
	//crossFade the view
	crossFader.crossFade();
}
```

Save the instance state
```java
@Override
protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
	//add the values which need to be saved from the crossFader to the bundle
	outState = crossFader.saveInstanceState(outState);
	super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
}
```
